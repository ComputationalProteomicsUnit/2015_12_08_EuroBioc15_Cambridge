## Learning from heterogeneous data sources
Lisa Breckels

* Where matters - we want to know where proteins live.
* Localisation maps using mass spectrometry and quantitative
  proteomics
* In a nutshell: LOPIT experiment - this is our primary data
* Here's how a result looks like - PCA plot, markers and
  classification
* Why not use auxiliary data such as GO (binary encoding), third party
  software (quantitative) or imaging (binary)?
* Risks and transfer learning
* Results: boxplot comparing true and false positives, based on old
  and new experiments
* TL algorithms: KNN-TL and SVM-TL
* Conclusions with link to pre-print
